<!-- In this lesson, the main element tag is introduced. This tag contains, as you might have guessed it, the main
     content of the page. This should not contain elements that repeat accross pages, such as navigation links or 
     banners, and there should be only ONE per page. See my solution below. -->

<header>
  <h1>Weapons of the Ninja</h1>
