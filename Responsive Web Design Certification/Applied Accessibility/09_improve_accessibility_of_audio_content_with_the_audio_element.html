<!-- In this lesson, the audio elemnt is introduced. This element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or stream
     content in the markup. Usually, it also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard 
     of hearing. The neccessary attribute for this element is the "controls" attribute to make the standar audio 
     controlls visible in the page. See my solution below. -->

  <header>
    <h1>Real Coding Ninjas</h1>

  <main>
    <p>A sound clip of Zersiax's screen reader in action.</p>
