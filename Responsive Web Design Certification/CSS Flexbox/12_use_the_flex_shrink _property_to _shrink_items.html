<!-- In this lesson, the flex-shrink property is introduced. This property, different from the ones learned before, does
     NOT apply to the flex parent container, but to the flex items. This property allows an element to shrink when the 
     width of the parent container is smaller than the combined widths of all the flex items within. The number value that
     is assigned determines how much it shrink, with higher being more shrink ratio. See my solution below. -->

<style>
  #box-container {
    display: flex;
    height: 500px;
  }
  #box-1 {
    background-color: dodgerblue;
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
    flex-shrink: 1;
  }

  #box-2 {
    background-color: orangered;
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
    flex-shrink: 2;
  }
</style>

<div id="box-container">
  <div id="box-1"></div>
  <div id="box-2"></div>
