<!-- In this lesson, pseudo-classes are introduced. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in
     order to select a specific state of the element. For example, in this case the hover state of an a element.
     See my solution below. -->

<style>
  a {
    color: #000;
  }
  a:hover {
    color: blue;
  }  
</style>
