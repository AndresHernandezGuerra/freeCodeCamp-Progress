<!-- In this lesson, the "absolute" positioning is introduced. This locks the element in place relative to its parent
     container. It also removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it, but
     its position can be controlled the same way as with "relative" positioning. See my solution below. -->

<style>
  #searchbar {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;    
    right: 50px;
  }
  section {
    position: relative;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <section>
    <form id="searchbar">
      <label for="search">Search:</label>
      <input type="search" id="search" name="search">
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Go!">
    </form>
  </section>
</body>
