<!-- In this lesson, a new way of defining colors is introduces. This is by using hsl() [hue, saturation, and lightness]
     where the "hue" of a color is its position in the 360deg wheel of colors. The saturation is the amount of gray it 
     has (with 0% being fully gray), and lightness means how much black or white it has (0% is black, 100% is white, and
     50% is the pure color). See my solution below. -->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
  }
  
  .green {
    background-color: hsl(120,100%,50%);
  }
  
  .cyan {
    background-color: hsl(180,100%,50%);
  }
  
  .blue {
    background-color: hsl(240,100%,50%);
  }
  
  div {
    display: inline-block;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
  
<div class="green"></div>
<div class="cyan"></div>
<div class="blue"></div>
