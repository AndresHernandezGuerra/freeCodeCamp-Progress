<!-- In this lesson, the CSS box model is introduced, and with it the position property. When an elements position
     is set to "relative" it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position. The left,
     right, top, and bottom properties paired with it determine how much it is moved away from each of those sides.
     All other elements still behave as though the item is in its normal position. See my solution below. -->
     
     <style>
  h2 {
    position: relative;
    top: 15px;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
</body>
