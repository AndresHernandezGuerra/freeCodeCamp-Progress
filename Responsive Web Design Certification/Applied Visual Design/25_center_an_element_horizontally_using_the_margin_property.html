<!-- In this lesson, centering elements with the margin property is introduced. This is possible by assigning the
     value of "auto" to the margin property of an element. With images, it is first necessary to set "display: block"
     See my solution below. -->

<style>
  div {
    background-color: blue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    margin: auto;
  }
</style>
<div></div>
