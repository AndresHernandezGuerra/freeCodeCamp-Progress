<!-- In this lesson, the linear-gradient option for background is introduced. This gives a background the ability
     to transition in a given direction, where 90deg makes a vertical gradient and 45deg is angled like a backslash.
     More than 2 colors can be specified, see my solution below. -->

<style>

  div{ 
    border-radius: 20px;
    width: 70%;
    height: 400px;
    margin: 50px auto;
    background: linear-gradient(35deg, #CCFFFF, #FFCCCC);
  }
