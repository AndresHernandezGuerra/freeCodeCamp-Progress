<!-- In this lesson, the "cubic-bezier" function is introduced. The X-axis of this coordinate system is the duration of 
     the animation (think of it as a time scale), and the Y-axis is the change in the animation. It consists of four main 
     points that sit on this 1 by 1 grid p0, p1, p2, and p3. Here, p0 and p3 are set - they are the beginning and end 
     points always located respectively at the origin (0, 0) and (1, 1). The x and y values for the other two points, need
     to be set and they dictate the shape of the curve for the animation to follow, in this case linear. See my solution below. -->
