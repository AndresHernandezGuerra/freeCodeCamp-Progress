<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- In this lesson, the doctype declaration is introduced. This is important because it lets the browsers know
     what version of html to use. The type declared here is HTML5, notice how the comments also have to go after
     the type declaration, this is the best practice. This is my solution. -->

<html>
  <h1> Declaring doctype as HTML5</h1>
