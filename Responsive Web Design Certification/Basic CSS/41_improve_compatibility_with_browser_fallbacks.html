<!-- In this lesson, compatibility improvement through browser fallback styles is introduced. This is necessary to
     have backup styles in case the browser does not support specific CSS styles. This is done by adding a declaration
     of the element with the fallback option right before the other declaration. See my solution before. -->

<style>
  :root {
    --red-color: red;
  }
  .red-box {
    background: red;
    background: var(--red-color);
    height: 200px;
    width:200px;
  }
</style>
<div class="red-box"></div>
