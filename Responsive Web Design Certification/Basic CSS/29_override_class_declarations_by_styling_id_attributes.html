<!-- In this lesson, a new way to override style is introduced. Here it is possible to see that, regardless of
     any style given by classes, using the id selector to style will override them and assign that style to the
     corresponding element. See my solution below. -->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
  #orange-text {
    color: orange;
  }
</style>
<h1 id="orange-text" class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>
