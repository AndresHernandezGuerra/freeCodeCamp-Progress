<!-- In this lesson, we learn how CSS deals with HTML elements that receive multiple styles that conflict with 
     one another. The case here is the color conflicting from the body element attribute and from the class that
     is declared after it and assigned to an element in the body. The class will prevale, see my solution below. -->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }

  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text">Hello World!</h1>
