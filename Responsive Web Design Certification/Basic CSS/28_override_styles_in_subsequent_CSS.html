<!-- In this lesson, it is possible to see how to override any style previously given to an element. Before it 
     was illustrated that classes will override style given to the whole body. Now, the most recent class can be 
     used to override any previous classes in the <style> tag. See my solution below. -->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="blue-text pink-text">Hello World!</h1>
